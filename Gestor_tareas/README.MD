# Test-Driven Development (TDD) involves a short development cycle

## Write a Test: Define a test for a new feature or functionality

Run the Test: The test should fail since the feature isn't implemented yet.

## Write Code: Implement the minimal code to make the test pass

## Run Tests

Ensure the test passes.

## Refactor: Clean up the code while ensuring tests still pass

## Repeat

Continue with the next feature.

This cycle helps ensure that your code meets the requirements and remains reliable as it evolves.
